This is the source code for the 3rd prize solution to the [Second National Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl) hosted by Kaggle.com. For documenation about the approach look [here](http://juliandewit.github.io/kaggle-ndsb/)

#### Dependencies & data
I used the anaconda default distribution with all the libraries that came with it.
Next to this I used opencv(cv2), pydicom and MxNet (20151228 but later version will most probably be fine).
For detailed windows 64 installation instructions look [here]().

The dicom data needs to be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl/data) and must be but in the data_kaggle/train /validate and /test folders.
